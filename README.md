# Project ROPEA
This is an initiative by Hanze university in collaboration with two students to demonstrate how robotics can be used in ocean by 2050 to regenerate the ecosystem and prevent excessive trash being built up.
## The files presented here show the logic behind production of the Virtual Reality training simulator "OilRig Training Simulator":-

* The [**GestureDetector script**](GestureDetector.cs) does this this this.
* The [**JoyStickControl script**](JoystickControl.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**LeverEvents script**](LeverEvents.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**PhysicsButton script**](PhysicsButton.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**Timer script**](Timer.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**PlayerData script**](PlayerData.cs), [**SaveData script**](SaveData.cs) and [**SaveSystem script**](SaveSystem.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**TriggerSystem script**](TriggerSystem.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**doorCollision script**](doorCollision.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**HandTrackingGrabber script**](HandTrackinGrabber.cs) does this this this.

### Additionally, there are 2 Videoclips which will give you a run-through of what to expect in the game and the internal sections of each script.
